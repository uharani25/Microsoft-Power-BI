# Microsoft-Power-BI
This repository is a IEEE format paper that puts forward my experience with Microsoft Power BI tool during my internship at a IT company.

I have worked on analysing the performance of the company's data warehouses and built a dashboard based off of the data I have gathered, cleansed and analyzed.

The dashboard that I built is a simple and easily understood by an person. Though it is simple, it gives good insights and helps the team to understand where and which databases in the warehouses are missing record. Simple insights like the following can be drawn from the dashboard I hae built.
1. How many tables are missing records and how many records are missing from each table?
2. The trend of the missing records, whether the number of missing records is increasing on a daily basis or reducing.
3. Identify if there is any data leak in the warehouse.
4. Filter the data displayed based off of the categories in the warehouse.
